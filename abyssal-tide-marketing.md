# **ABYSSAL TIDE**
## *A Neo-Pirate Strategy Saga*

---

### **THE OLD WORLD IS DEAD. THE SEA IS YOUR KINGDOM.**

The skies turned hostile. The banks collapsed. The empires fell. Now, in the sun-scorched Caribbean of 2085, advanced sailing ships rule the waves and three treasures drive the world: **Aetherium Fuel**, **Vita-Algae**, and **CanaFiber**.

You are a captain. Your ship is your home, your weapon, and your legacy. Navigate treacherous waters, build your crew, raid corporate convoys, and carve your name into the annals of a new age of piracy.

---

### **A WORLD REBORN THROUGH COLLAPSE**

**The Great Atmospheric Shift** made the skies deadly. **The Fuel Famine** starved the engines. **The Great Devaluation** shattered the currencies. What remains is a fractured world of:

- **Mega-Corporations** hoarding resources behind armored fleets
- **Free Port City-States** where anything can be bought or sold
- **Resource Nations** defending their precious algae farms and fiber plantations
- **Pirates** who refuse to kneel to any flag

The Panama Canal lies silent - the **Broken Bridge** - forcing all trade through pirate-infested Caribbean waters. Every merchant vessel, every corporate convoy, every treasure fleet must pass through *your* hunting grounds.

### **YOUR SHIP IS EVERYTHING**

In the tradition of **Final Fantasy Tactics** and **Valkyria Chronicles**, ABYSSAL TIDE puts you in command of a living, breathing vessel that grows with your choices.

**SHIP MANAGEMENT**
| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Hull & Rigging** | Upgrade from a salvaged sloop to a multi-hulled war galleon |
| **Crew Quarters** | House specialists, gunners, engineers, and boarding parties |
| **Cargo Hold** | Store plundered Aetherium, smuggled Vita-Algae, or bulk CanaFiber |
| **Armory** | Equip railguns, harpoon launchers, or experimental directed-energy weapons |
| **Engine Room** | Balance precious Aetherium fuel for emergency power vs. profit |

Your ship reflects every decision. Scars from battles past. Trophies from legendary raids. A crew that remembers your choices.

---

### **HEX-BASED TACTICAL COMBAT**

When sails appear on the horizon, the hex grid emerges.

**NAVAL ENGAGEMENT**
- Position your ship to catch the wind or block escape routes
- Manage sail configuration, speed, and facing
- Target enemy masts to cripple, hulls to sink, or decks to board
- Weather and sea conditions alter every engagement

**BOARDING ACTIONS**
- Deploy your crew in deck-to-deck tactical combat
- Each crew member has unique classes: **Cutlass**, **Marksman**, **Sapper**, **Medic**
- Capture officers for ransom, seize cargo, or scuttle the vessel
- Permadeath makes every life precious

### **THE NEW TREASURES**

Three commodities drive the world economy. Master their trade routes. Control their flow.

**AETHERIUM FUEL** *(The New Gold)*
> Refined from deep-sea Grav-Coral, this volatile ultralight fuel powers the most advanced technology. Corporate Treasure Fleets guard it with their lives. One successful raid could fund a fleet.

**VITA-ALGAE** *(The New Sugar)*
> Farmed in Caribbean shallows, refined into life-saving pharmaceuticals and industrial lubricants. Compact, valuable, and always in demand on the black market.

**CANAFIBER** *(The New Cotton)*
> The universal commodity. Sailcloth, rope, clothing, construction composites. Bulk cargo that keeps the wheels turning. Low glamour, high volume, constant profit.

### **FORGE YOUR LEGEND**

ABYSSAL TIDE features a branching narrative where your reputation shapes the world.

**FACTION REPUTATION**
- **AetherCorp**: The corporate giant. Their enemy or their privateer?
- **The Free Ports**: Neutral ground. Your haven or your hunting ground?
- **The Trident Confederation**: The pirate nation. Rise through their ranks or forge your own path?
- **Resource Nations**: Desperate allies or easy prey?

**CREW LOYALTY**
Your crew remembers. Spare a merchant captain, and word spreads of your mercy. Slaughter a surrendered crew, and fear precedes you. Some crew thrive under a ruthless captain. Others will mutiny.

**THE CAPTAIN'S LOG**
Every voyage, every battle, every choice is recorded. Your story becomes legend - told in taverns from Nassau to Kingston.

### **SURVIVE THE CARIBBEAN**

The sea is not your only enemy.

- **Hurricanes** scatter fleets and create opportunities for the bold
- **Corporate Patrols** hunt pirates with advanced sensor suites and drone swarms
- **Rival Captains** compete for the same prizes and the same glory
- **The Broken Bridge** - the ruins of the Panama Canal - holds secrets and salvage for those brave enough to explore

### **THE AGE OF SAIL HAS RETURNED**

*Not the romantic fantasy of the 18th century - but something harder, stranger, and more desperate.*

Advanced composite hulls. Automated sail arrays. Railgun broadsides. Corporate Treasure Fleets laden with glowing Aetherium canisters. And you, captain, with nothing but your ship, your crew, and your cunning.

The old world built walls. The new world builds ships.
